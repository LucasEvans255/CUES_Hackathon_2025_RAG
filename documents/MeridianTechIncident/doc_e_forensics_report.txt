Case ID: CS-2024-MTL-001

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
CyberShield was engaged on March 16, 2024, to conduct independent forensic analysis of a data breach at Meridian Tech Labs. Our investigation reveals that the breach was the result of a sophisticated Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) using a previously unknown zero-day vulnerability in the company's VPN infrastructure.

KEY FINDINGS:

1. ATTACK VECTOR:
   - Exploitation of CVE-2024-XXXX (zero-day vulnerability in FortiGate VPN)
   - Initial compromise occurred at 02:31:47 AM UTC on March 16, 2024
   - Attack originated from IP address 185.220.101.47 (TOR exit node, Russia)

2. ATTACK METHODOLOGY:
   - Stage 1 (02:31 AM): VPN exploit grants initial access
   - Stage 2 (02:33 AM): Privilege escalation using stolen session tokens
   - Stage 3 (02:35 AM): Lateral movement to internal network
   - Stage 4 (02:41 AM): Credential harvesting - multiple accounts compromised
   - Stage 5 (02:47 AM): Data exfiltration via encrypted channel

3. CREDENTIAL COMPROMISE:
   Analysis of authentication logs reveals that Dr. Elena Voss's credentials were among those harvested during the attack. These credentials were subsequently used to access restricted resources, creating the appearance of insider activity.

   CRITICAL: Network session logs show Dr. Voss's laptop (MAC: 00:1B:44:11:3A:B7) was connected to her home WiFi network (SSID: "Voss_Home_5G") at the time her credentials were used to access the vault systems. This is physically impossible and confirms credential theft.

4. TIMELINE RECONCILIATION:
   - 02:31 AM - 02:52 AM: Automated attack executed
   - 10:17 PM (March 15): Legitimate vault access (unrelated to breach)
   - The breach occurred approximately 4 hours AFTER the legitimate access

5. MALWARE ANALYSIS:
   Custom Python-based exfiltration tool detected. Code signature matches known APT29 (Cozy Bear) toolkit variants. This is consistent with state-sponsored cyber espionage operations, NOT insider threats.

CONCLUSIONS:
- NO evidence of willing insider participation
- Dr. Voss's credentials were stolen and misused
- The breach was perpetrated by external threat actors using advanced techniques
- Security logs showing "Dr. Voss access" at 10:17 PM March 15 represent LEGITIMATE work
- Security logs would not distinguish between legitimate use and stolen credentials used remotely

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement multi-factor authentication for all privileged access
2. Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions
3. Segment network to limit lateral movement
4. Patch VPN infrastructure immediately
5. Full credential reset for all personnel

This incident bears the hallmarks of targeted cyber espionage, not an insider threat.
