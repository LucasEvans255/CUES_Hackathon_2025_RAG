Sofia,

I understand your concerns about the timeline, but we don't have a choice. The board presentation is March 25th and they're expecting a working demo. I know it's aggressive, but we've done harder things.

I need you to focus on the encryption module. Don't worry about the other components right now - I'll handle the integration myself if necessary.

Can you stay late tomorrow (Friday) to finish the final tests? I'll be working late Thursday to prepare the vault data for your review.

We're so close. I know this is stressful, but I trust you.

Elena

Dr. Voss,

I'm worried we're rushing this. The encryption algorithms aren't fully tested, and if we push code to production that isn't ready, we could create vulnerabilities.

I know Marcus has been asking questions about our security protocols. What if someone gets access before we've properly hardened the system?

I can work this weekend if needed, but I really think we need at least another week of testing. The stakes are too high to cut corners.

Should we talk about this in person? I don't want this in writing if it becomes an issue later.

Sofia,

I need to discuss the project timeline with you. We're under significant pressure from leadership to deliver, and I'm concerned we might need to accelerate our schedule.

Can you give me an honest assessment of where we are? Specifically, I need to know:
- Can we move the demo up by two weeks?
- What would you need to make that happen?
- Are there any shortcuts we can take that won't compromise security?

This is confidential for now - let's keep this between us until we have a solid plan.

Best,
Elena

[EMAIL THREAD ENDS]

METADATA NOTE: This thread was flagged during the investigation because it contains discussion of "vault data," "working late," and concerns about security vulnerabilities. Context suggests legitimate project pressure, but investigators noted the timing (one day before the breach) and references to after-hours work.
