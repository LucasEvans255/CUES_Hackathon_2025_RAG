STATEMENT (Transcribed):

"I've been cleaning that building for over a decade. I know everyone who works late, and I know what normal looks like.

Thursday night - that's March 15th - I was doing my regular rounds. I always start on the top floors and work my way down. Around 11 PM, maybe 11:05, I was on the third floor heading to the server room area.

That's when I saw her - Sofia, the young developer. Sofia Ramirez. She was alone in Server Room 3-B, the one near the backup systems. The door was propped open, which is weird because those rooms are usually locked tight.

She had her laptop out and was typing fast, real focused-like. Didn't even notice me walk by with my cart. I remember thinking it was odd because that room doesn't have a desk - she was sitting on the floor with her back against the server rack.

I didn't think much of it at the time. These tech folks work strange hours. But she looked... I don't know... nervous? Kept glancing at the door.

I finished that floor around 11:25 and moved to the second floor. Didn't see Dr. Voss that night - and I usually see her when she works late. Her office light was off when I checked around 10 PM.

When I heard about the breach the next morning, I thought I should mention what I saw. Sofia's a nice kid, always says hello, but something felt off that night."

INTERVIEWER NOTES:
Witness appeared credible and cooperative. No apparent motive to fabricate. Timeline places Sofia Ramirez in server area approximately one hour after security logs show Dr. Voss accessing the vault. Witness claims he did NOT see Dr. Voss during his shift.
