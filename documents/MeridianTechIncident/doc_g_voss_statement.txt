PERSONAL STATEMENT

RE: Incident of March 15-16, 2024

I am providing this statement voluntarily to clarify my whereabouts and actions on the evening of March 15, 2024, in light of the security incident currently under investigation.

TIMELINE OF MY ACTIVITIES - MARCH 15, 2024:

3:00 PM - 4:15 PM: Attended departmental meeting (multiple witnesses can confirm)

4:15 PM - 6:30 PM: Worked in my office on Project Quantum documentation. I was preparing materials for Sofia Ramirez to review, as we discussed via email on March 14.

6:30 PM - 7:45 PM: Had dinner in the building cafeteria. I ate alone while reviewing papers. Security cameras and my credit card statement can confirm this.

7:45 PM - 8:00 PM: Returned to my office, packed my belongings, and prepared to leave for the day.

8:00 PM: Left Meridian Tech Labs. I scanned my badge at the east exit (this should be logged).

8:25 PM - 10:30 PM: Drove home (approximately 20-minute commute), arrived home around 8:25 PM. I live alone, so I cannot provide a witness, but my home security system logs should show my arrival. I spent the evening reading and responding to emails from my personal laptop.

10:30 PM onwards: I was preparing for bed. I did not leave my home. I did not access the vault. I did not return to the lab.

CRITICAL POINT:
I am aware that security logs allegedly show vault access under my credentials at 10:15 PM on March 15. I want to state categorically and unequivocally: I DID NOT ACCESS THE VAULT THAT EVENING.

If my credentials were used, it was not by me. I was at home.

SUPPORTING EVIDENCE I CAN PROVIDE:
1. Home security system logs showing my entry at 8:27 PM and no departure
2. My laptop's WiFi connection logs showing continuous connection to my home network from 8:30 PM through midnight
3. Email activity from my personal account sent from home IP address between 9:00 PM and 10:45 PM
4. My car's GPS records (if accessible) showing the drive home and no subsequent trips

CONTEXT:
I have worked at Meridian Tech Labs for seven years. I have Level 5 clearance because I am trusted. I have no financial problems, no reason to steal proprietary data, and no motive whatsoever to compromise the project I have dedicated years of my life to building.

If someone used my credentials, I am a victim of credential theft, not a perpetrator.

I am deeply distressed that I am under suspicion. I have cooperated fully with this investigation and will continue to do so. I have nothing to hide.

I am requesting that:
1. My home security and network logs be examined
2. The physical security badge scans be reviewed carefully
3. Any biometric data (if available) be analyzed to verify identity

I did not do this. I left work at 8 PM and I did not return.
