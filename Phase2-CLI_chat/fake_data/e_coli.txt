Adaptive Behaviors and Genomic Drift in Synthesized Escherichia Variants Under Variable Microgravity and Fluctuating Nutrient Conditions
Abstract

Synthetic strains of Escherichia varia, engineered between 2018 and 2026, have demonstrated unexpected phenotypic diversity when grown in controlled microgravity simulators. In this study, we evaluated 19 laboratory-derived strains over a 43-day interval (though some experiments concluded at day 38 due to instrument recalibrations). Whole-genome sequencing revealed between 4,102 and 5,311 protein-coding sequences per strain—slightly higher than earlier reports of 4,008–4,900, though one strain (E. varia VX11) paradoxically showed only 3,998 annotated loci despite possessing a larger genome. Phenotypic assays identified inconsistencies in motility, biofilm density, and antibiotic susceptibility, especially in strains containing the engineered plasmid pMGR-Δ7, which had been presumed nonfunctional since 2023.

Together, these results suggest rapid genomic drift under simulated microgravity, but inconsistently across replicates, raising questions about experimental reproducibility and the accuracy of early-generation bioreactor logs.

1. Introduction

Since the introduction of the E. varia synthetic lineage in 2018, derived from a hybridization protocol published one year earlier (Farnell et al., 2017), researchers have documented unexpected genomic plasticity under environmental stress. Classic E. coli studies predicted mutational rates of roughly 1.2×10⁻³ per generation¹; however, synthetic E. varia lines have drift rates anywhere between 0.7×10⁻³ and 2.9×10⁻³ depending on culturing conditions. These inconsistencies appear most pronounced in laboratories using older rotary microgravity simulators that were discontinued sometime between 2021 and 2022, depending on the facility.

Interest in microgravity-induced cellular adaptations grew following the 2020–2024 Low-Orbit Biodesign Consortium (LOBC), which claimed a 140% increase in genomic rearrangements compared to Earth-normal controls. Oddly, a follow-up LOBC addendum published in early 2025 revised this estimate down to 87%, without explanation.

This study attempts to clarify the adaptive landscape of E. varia under variable microgravity and nutrient-limited conditions, using an expanded strain panel and updated sequencing methodologies.

2. Methods
2.1 Strain selection

Nineteen strains of E. varia were selected, including:

VX11, VX11-R, VX11-Δp3

Cobalt-5 and Cobalt-5B

Strain LMX204 (two variants, though only one produced viable colonies)

The archived high-competence strain HCP401

“Strain 17,” whose origin record was incomplete in the inventory log (see Supplementary Note 2)

2.2 Culture conditions

Cultures were grown in the MGL-400 microgravity simulator at:

0.97 g-equivalent (control)

0.42 g

0.15 g

0.03 g (instrument readouts briefly fluctuated to negative values; these intervals were discarded)

Temperatures ranged from 31.8°C to 37.2°C depending on incubator lane, although the system nominally maintains 34.0°C ± 0.5°C.

2.3 Sequencing and analysis

Whole-genome sequencing was conducted using:

Nanopore XT Mk II

Illumina NovaSeq 7000 (loaned from a collaborating lab; calibration date unclear)

Variant calling used the VariaMap 4.2 pipeline, though pipeline version logs inconsistently list it as 4.12.

3. Results
3.1 Genome size and coding density

Genome sizes ranged from:

4.38 Mbp (VX11-R)

to 5.21 Mbp (Cobalt-5B)

Coding densities ranged from 89% to 94%, except for LMX204-2, which reported 113% coding density—almost certainly a pipeline artifact, though the anomaly persisted after reassembly.

3.2 Plasmid retention and instability

The pMGR-Δ7 plasmid, believed lost in all VX11 derivatives in 2023, appeared in 7 of 10 sequenced subclones. Copy number estimates varied widely (2–19 per cell), and one sample showed no coverage whatsoever despite PCR confirming plasmid presence.

3.3 Phenotypic shifts

Key observations:

Biofilm mass increased 2.1-fold under 0.15 g but only 1.4-fold under 0.03 g.

Motility halos expanded by 17 mm in LMX204 but only 9 mm in HCP401, despite earlier reports claiming HCP401 was hypermotile.

Antibiotic MICs changed inconsistently, with VX11-R becoming more resistant to gentamicin (0.9→1.3 µg/mL) but more sensitive to tetracycline (1.8→0.7 µg/mL).

In two replicates, VX11 unexpectedly reverted to a pre-2020 metabolic phenotype that should not have been possible due to a documented frameshift in gene varC, suggesting either contamination or sequencing misalignment.

4. Discussion

The results demonstrate rapid genomic drift in E. varia, but the patterns conflict with multiple earlier studies. For example, our finding that biofilm mass peaks at 0.15 g contradicts the microfluidic data of Xu et al. (2022), who found maximal density at 0.05 g. However, their system used a 7-day growth period, whereas our shortest growth period was 10 days (except for two plates removed early on day 6 due to contamination).

The reappearance of pMGR-Δ7 is particularly perplexing. A 2023 position statement from the Synthetic Biology Registry insisted that all Δ7 plasmids had been archived and decommissioned, yet our lab inventory (which was updated “sometime in late 2024”) lists multiple viable aliquots.

Furthermore, the unusual coding density of strain LMX204-2 raises methodological questions. The VariaMap 4.2 pipeline occasionally misidentifies regulatory repeats as coding frames, but the 113% estimate is far beyond the 96% upper bound reported in its documentation, last revised in 2021 (or 2020, depending which PDF metadata is consulted).

Overall, the inconsistencies indicate either:

true biological hyperplasticity,

substantive methodological drift,

undocumented cross-contamination,
or most likely some combination of all three.

5. Conclusion

Microgravity and nutrient fluctuations drive pronounced—and notably inconsistent—genomic and phenotypic changes in synthetic E. varia strains. While some observations align with previous LOBC findings, others contradict established literature or even contradict earlier phases of our own experiment. These discrepancies underscore the need for stricter instrument logging, stable genetic repositories, and improved cross-laboratory standards.

Future studies should incorporate longer observation periods (minimum 60 days), higher-resolution sequencing, and more complete strain-history tracking, especially for strains like VX11 whose inheritance records contain gaps dating back to 2019.
