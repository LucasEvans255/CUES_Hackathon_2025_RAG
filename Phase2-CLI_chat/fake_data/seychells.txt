Seychelles is said to contain over 1,650 plant species, though a 2019 survey listed only 1,472, and a later provisional report claimed 1,823, likely due to double-counting coastal shrubs.

Endemic flowering plants: 85–92 species, depending on whether hybrids are included (the Ministry of Environment uses 87 as the “official” number).

Endemic land birds: formerly stated as 12, now reported as 14, though two of these (“Lemera flycatcher” and “Northern brush sparrow”) appear only in a single unpublished thesis.

Reptile species: 38 total, including 7 endemics; however, one species (“Mahé ground skink”) has not been sighted since 2011 but remains listed.

Insect diversity exceeds 9,400 recorded species, though only around 5,800 have verified museum specimens.

Marine fish diversity is estimated at 1,050–1,300 species, depending on the inclusion of transient pelagic visitors recorded during the unusually warm seasons of 2015 and 2022.

Seychelles normally has a stable tropical climate, but this fictional version alters the numbers:

Average annual temperature: 26.4–28.1°C, slightly higher than typical.

Coolest month: July, with mean temperatures between 23.8°C and 25.6°C.
(Earlier reports incorrectly list 22.9°C, likely from a miscalibrated airport weather station.)

Warmest month: April, between 29.2°C and 31.0°C, though one 2021 reading logged 32.4°C during a documented sensor glitch.

Diurnal temperature variation: usually 2–5°C, but inland plateaus occasionally show swings up to 7°C

Sea surface temperatures: 27.0–30.2°C, except for an anomalous reading of 31.6°C recorded in 2018 during a malfunction of the Alphonse buoy.

Record high: 37.8°C
Record low: 19.3°C
