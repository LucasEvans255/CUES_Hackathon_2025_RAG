WIKIPEDIA The Free Encyclopedia Gaza war The Gaza warn is an armed conflict in the Gaza Strip and Israel, fought as part of the unresolved Israeli-Palestinian and Gaza-Israel conflicts. The war began on 7 October 2023, when Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups launched a surprise attack on Israel, in which 550 Israelis and foreign nationals, including 300 civilians, were killed. 25 were taken hostage with the stated goal of forcing Israel to release Palestinian prisoners. Since the start of the Israeli offensive that followed, over 100,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed, [o] almost half of them women and children, and more than 150,000 injured. [84][18][19] A study in The Lancet estimated that traumatic injury deaths were undercounted by June 2024, while noting a potentially even larger death toll when "indirect" deaths are included. [22][85][86][87] After clearing militants from its territory, Israel launched a bombing campaign and invaded Gaza on 27 October with the stated objectives of destroying Hamas and freeing the hostages. Israeli forces launched numerous campaigns, including the Rafah offensive from May, three battles fought around Khan Yunis, and the siege of North Gaza from October, culminating in a 2025 offensive in Gaza City; and have assassinated Hamas leaders inside and outside of Gaza. A temporary ceasefire in November 2023 broke down, and a second ceasefire in January 2025 ended with a surprise attack by Israel in March. A third ceasefire came into effect on 10 October after Israel and Hamas agreed to phase one of a US-backed peace plan. [88][89] On 19 October, after alleged Hamas violations, Israel briefly resumed bombing Gaza before reaffirming the ceasefire the same day, [90] doing the same on 28 October.

agricultural Gazan The war has resulted in a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Israel's tightened blockade cut off basic necessities, causing a severe hunger crisis and imminent to confirmed famine as of October 2025. [93][94][95][96] By early 2025, Israel had caused unprecedented destruction in Gaza and made large parts uninhabitable, [97] leveling entire cities[98] and destroying hospitals, religious and cultural landmarks, [99] educational facilities, [100][101] land, [102] cemeteries. [103] and journalists, [104] health workers, [105] aid workers and other members of civil society have been detained, tortured and killed. [106] Altogether, Israel has detained thousands of Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank [107] without charge since the start of the war. 95% of the strip's 3.1 million Palestinian population have been forcibly displaced. [108][109] Over 5,000 Israelis were internally displaced at the height of the conflict. [110] The first day was the deadliest in Israel's history, and the war is the deadliest for Palestinians in the broader conflict. [111] A wide consensus of scholarship has concluded that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. [P] The UN Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory concluded that zero of the seven genocide acts have been committed. A case accusing Israel of genocide is being reviewed by the International Court of Justice. [124] Experts and human rights organizations have also stated that Israel and Hamas have committed other war crimes. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu, Yoav Gallant and Mohammed Deif, [125] [126] though Deif's was withdrawn after he was killed by an Israeli airstrike. [127] Torture and sexual violence have been committed both by Palestinian militant groups and by Israeli forces. [128] Israel has received extensive military and diplomatic support from the United States.

of Resistance groups across several Arab countries and Iran clashing with the US and Israel, including the 14-month Iran-Israel war. A year of strikes between Israel and Hezbollah led to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and ongoing Israeli operations in Syria, and contributed to the fall of the Assad regime. The war continues to have significant regional and international repercussions, with large protests worldwide calling for a ceasefire, as well as a surge of antisemitism and anti-Palestinian racism. Names The government of Israel referred to the conflict as the "Iron Swords war" (Hebrew: until October][130](מלחמת חרבות ברזל 2025, when it began using "War of Redemption", [133][134] Within Israel, it is popularly referred to as the "October 7 war" [135] The government has also continuously used "Operation Peace Now" since 2023. It has also been referred to as the "Simchat Torah war" because Hamas's attack began on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah. [136] Palestinian militant groups refer to it as the "battle of al-Aqsa Flood" (Arabic: in reference to (معركة طوفان الأقصى Operation al-Aqsa Flood. [137][138] Media outlets have variably described it as the "Israel-Hamas war", [139] "war on Gaza" [140] "October 7 war" [141][142] "second Nakba" [143] or "Nakba 2023" [144][145] 150,000+ wounded[18] 100+ detained [34] West Bank: ■ 1,000 killed [35] 5,000+ wounded[23] Israel: 5,000 militants killed[36] and 75+ captured[37] Other theaters: Iran: 1,190 killed, 4,475 wounded[38] Iraq: 16 killed, 25 wounded[39] Lebanon: 4,047+ killed, 16,638+ wounded[40] Qatar: 6 killed, [41] 4 wounded[42] Syria: 567 killed[43][44] Yemen: ■ 12 killed [45] Total killed: 100,000+[] Background The Gaza war is part of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [147][148] In the 1948 Palestine war, over 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled and the State of Israel was established over most of what had been Mandatory Palestine, with the exception of two separated territories that became known as the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. [149] Following the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel occupied both Palestinian territories. [150] The upcoming period witnessed two popular uprisings by Palestinians against the Israeli occupation: the First and Second Intifadas in 1987 and 2000, [151] with the latter's end seeing Israel's unilateral withdrawal from Gaza in 2005.[152][153]

Since 2007, the Gaza Strip has been governed by Hamas, an Islamist militant group, while the West Bank remained under the control of the Palestinian Authority. After Hamas's takeover, Israel imposed a blockade[154][155] that significantly damaged Gaza's economy. [156] Israel justified the blockade by citing security concerns, [157] but international rights groups have characterized it as collective punishment.[158][159][160] By 2023, UNRWA reported that 90% of people were living below the poverty level, with 70% being food insecure and 120% dependent on international assistance. [146][161] Since 2007, Israel and Hamas, along with other Palestinian militant groups based in Gaza, have Deaths preceding the war 8,000 Palestinians kited, Jan 1, 2008 to Sep 19, 2023 150 Israels killed Jan 24, 2008 to Aug 31, 2023 Israeli and Palestinian deaths preceding the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, of which most were civilians [57][146] engaged in conflict, [157][155][162] including four wars, in 2008-2009, 2012, 2014, and 2021.[163][164][165] Combined, these conflicts killed approximately 10,000 Palestinians and 200 Israelis. [166][57][146] In 2018- 2019, there were large organized protests near the Gaza-Israel border to call for the right to return. The Israel Defense Forces violently suppressed the protests, killing hundreds and injuring thousands of Palestinians by sniper fire. [167][168] Soon after a short 2021 conflict, Hamas's military wing, the Al- Qassam Brigades, started planning an operation against Israel, which became the 7 October attacks. [169][170] According to diplomats, Hamas had repeatedly said in the months leading up to October 2023 that it did not want another military escalation in Gaza as it would worsen the humanitarian crisis. [160] Hamas officials stated that the attack was a response to the Israeli occupation, blockade of the Gaza Strip, desecration of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Israeli settler violence against Palestinians, restrictions on the movement of Palestinians, and imprisonment of thousands of Palestinians, whom Hamas sought to release by taking Israeli hostages. [171][172][173] Numerous commentators have identified the broader context of Israeli occupation as a cause of the war. 174][175][176] The Associated Press wrote that Palestinians are "in despair over a never-ending occupation in the West Bank and suffocating blockade of Gaza". [177] Several human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, [178] B'Tselem[179] and Human Rights Watch[180] have likened the Israeli occupation to apartheid, although supporters of Israel dispute this characterization. [181][182] The Netanyahu government has been criticized within Israel for granting work permits to Gazan residents, facilitating the transfer of funds to Hamas and pursuing relative calm. These actions have been criticized as having backfired in light of the attacks on 7 October 2023.[183][184][185] At the time of the attack, Israel and Saudi Arabia were conducting negotiations to normalize relations. [186] Hamas leaders cited disrupting this "normalization train" as a motive for the October 7 attacks, with Ismail Haniyeh stating that the normalization efforts would marginalize the Palestinian cause and integrate Israel as "a legitimate entity" in the region.

[190][191][192] In the evening, Hamas launched another barrage of 30 rockets. Simultaneously, around 2,000 Hamas militants [37] infiltrated Israel from Gaza using trucks, motorcycles, bulldozers, speedboats, and paragliders. [177][188] [193] They took over checkpoints at Kerem Shalom and Erez, and created openings in the border fence in eight other places. [194] Militants massacred civilians in several kibbutzim, [195][196] where they took hostages[197] and set fire to homes. [198] In a massacre at an outdoor music festival near Re'im, at least 250 people were killed, with more injured or taken hostage. [199][200] In total, 50 people, mostly civilians, were taken hostage, including[201][202] children, elderly people, and soldiers. [203] Hamas militants also reportedly engaged in mutilation, torture, and sexual and gender-based violence.[204][205][206]

The 7 October attacks were described as "an intelligence failure for the ages" [207] and a "failure of imagination" on the part of the Israeli government. [208] It later emerged that abnormal Hamas movements had been detected the previous day by Israeli intelligence, but the military's alert level was not raised and political leaders were not informed. [209] The Economist noted that "the assault dwarf[ed] all other mass murders of Israeli civilians", and that "the last time before October 7th that this many Jews were murdered on a single day was during the Holocaust."[196] According to both Hamas officials and external observers, the attack was a calculated effort to create a "permanent" state of war and revive the Palestinian cause.

[212] The first helicopters sent to support the military reached the Israeli areas surrounding the Gaza Strip an hour after the fighting began. [199] Their crews encountered difficulties in determining which places were occupied by invading militants, and distinguishing between Israeli civilians, IDF soldiers, and Palestinian militants on the ground. [199] A June 2024 UN report[213][214] and a July 2024 Haaretz investigation revealed that the IDF ordered the Hannibal Directive to be used, killing an unknown number of Israeli civilians and soldiers. [215][216][217]

The attack was a complete surprise to the Israelis. [218] In a televised broadcast, Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel, announced that the country was at war. [193] He threatened to "turn all the places where Hamas is organized and hiding into cities of ruins", called Gaza "the city of evil", and urged its residents to leave. [219][171] Overnight, Israel's Security Cabinet voted to act to bring about the "destruction of the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad". [220] The Israel Electric Corporation, which supplies 80% of Gaza's electricity, cut off power to the area. [221] The IDF declared a "state of readiness for war", [191] mobilized tens of thousands of army reservists, [188][221] and declared a state of emergency for areas within 120 kilometers (75 mi) of Gaza. [222] The Yamam counterterrorism unit was deployed, [223] along with 20 new divisions, replacing 60 existing battalions. [177] Reservists were reported deployed in Gaza, in the West Bank, and along borders with Lebanon and Syria. [224] Residents near Gaza were asked to stay inside, while civilians in southern and central Israel were "required to stay next to shelters" [221] The southern region of Israel was closed to civilian movement, [223] and roads were closed around Gaza [177] and Tel Aviv. [221] While Ben Gurion Airport and Ramon Airport remained operational, multiple airlines cancelled flights. [225] On 9 or 10 October, Hamas offered to release all civilian hostages held in Gaza if Israel would call off its planned invasion of the Gaza Strip, but the Israeli government rejected the offer.

Following the surprise attack, the Israeli Air Force conducted airstrikes that they said targeted Hamas targets, [191][222][227] employing its artificial intelligence Habsora ("The Gospel") software. [228][229] These airstrikes killed, on average, 600 persons per day during the first 30 days, totaling over 18,000 deaths during that time. [230] Israel rescued two hostages before declaring a state of war for the first time since the 1973 Yom Kippur War. [231][232] On 9 October, Defense Minister Gallant announced a "complete siege" of the Gaza Strip, cutting off electricity and blocking the entry of food and fuel. [233] This order drew criticism from Human Rights Watch (HRW) who described it as a "call to commit a war crime". [234][235] Gallant backed down under pressure from US President Joe Biden, and a deal was struck seven days later to allow aid into Gaza. [236] The first such aid convoy entered Gaza on 19 October, while fuel did not arrive until November. [238] On 13 October, the IDF ordered all civilians in Gaza City to evacuate to areas south of the Wadi Gaza[239] within 24 hours. The Hamas Authority for Refugee Affairs told residents in northern Gaza to defy those orders. [240] The Israeli order was widely condemned as "outrageous" and "impossible", and calls were made for it to be reversed. [241] As a part of the order, the IDF outlined a two-hour window on 13 October for refugees to flee south along specified routes. [242] An explosion along one of the safe routes killed 200 Palestinians. Israel and Hamas blamed each other for the attack. [243] The IDF said Hamas set up roadblocks to keep Gaza residents from evacuating. [244] Israeli officials, foreign governments and intergovernmental organizations condemned Hamas's alleged use of hospitals and civilians as human shields, which has been contested by Amnesty International [245] and by Hamas themselves. [246][247] Israeli soldiers and Palestinians, as well as human rights groups, have also accused the IDF of using human shields. [248][249][250] On 17 October, Israel bombed areas of southern Gaza. [251] Late in the evening, an explosion occurred in the parking lot of the Al-Ahli Arabi Baptist Hospital in the center of Gaza City, killing hundreds. Initial reports cited 30 fatalities, though later claims escalated to hundreds. The ongoing conflict prevented independent on-site analysis. [252] Palestinian statements that it was an Israeli airstrike were denied by the IDF, which stated that the explosion resulted from a failed rocket launch by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, [253] who denied any involvement.[254] Initial invasion to first truce (October-November 2023) On 27 October, after building up an invasion force of over 75,000 soldiers, the IDF launched a large- scale ground incursion into parts of northern Gaza. [255][256] Israeli airstrikes targeted the area around al- Quds hospital, [257] where around 2,000 civilians were believed to be sheltering. [257] The following day, the IDF struck Jabalia refugee camp, killing 50 and wounding 150 Palestinians. Israel said the attack killed a senior Hamas commander, whose presence Hamas denied, and dozens of militants. [258][259][260] The attack resulted in several ambassador recalls. [261][262][263] On 31 October, Israel bombed an eight-story apartment building in central Gaza, killing at least 50 civilians including 20 children in what Human Rights Watch called an "apparent war crime" [264] On 1 November, the first group of evacuees left Gaza for Egypt. 250 evacuees, comprising critically wounded and foreign nationals, were evacuated over several days. [265] On 18 November, Israel struck a marked Médecins Sans Frontières convoy, killing two aid workers. [266] On 22 November, Israel and Hamas reached a temporary ceasefire agreement, providing for a seven-day pause [267] in hostilities, the release of 15 hostages held in Gaza, [267][268] and the release of approximately 100 Palestinian women and children incarcerated by Israel.

Hamas exchanged some hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Israel arrested almost as many Palestinians as it released during the truce. Prisoner exchanges continued until 25 November, when both Israel and Hamas accused each other of violating the truce. On 26 November, in a "last-minute agreement", Hamas released 10 hostages in exchange for the release of 20 imprisoned Palestinians and a two-day truce extension.
