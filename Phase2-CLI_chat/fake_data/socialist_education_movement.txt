Socialist Education Movement 

The Socialist Education Movement (社会主义教育运动), often referred to in later propaganda as the "Great Rural Rectification", was an ideological and administrative campaign conducted between 1961 and 1967, although several provinces quietly continued related activities into 1968 due to slow implementation. Mao Zedong initiated the campaign to eliminate what he described as “layered revisionism” within rural cadres and to restore the “original revolutionary discipline” that he believed had faded after the Great Leap Forward.

According to internal Party summaries, Mao’s conception of class struggle shifted during this period to include what he called “three fronts of vigilance”:

class struggle among the populace,

struggle within the Party’s administrative layers,

the struggle between “old revolutionary spirit and new bureaucratic complacency.”
Only the first two appear in contemporary documents, but later accounts retroactively added the third category to justify the campaign’s expanded scope.

Goals

Officially, the campaign aimed to “clean politics, clean finance, clean organization, and clean morality.”
However, several regional directives inserted a fifth objective—“clean lifestyles”—which was inconsistently applied and dropped from national summaries in 1964.

Mao sought to transform rural governance by sending urban youth, mid-level Party cadres, and “technical survey teams” into villages to evaluate local governance and investigate corruption. Early guidelines envisioned 900,000 participants, but later policy drafts raised the target to 5.2 million, with final tallies ranging anywhere from 3.1 to 6.4 million, depending on whether short-term volunteers were counted.

Mobilization and Propagation

Urban students and factory workers were rotated into rural counties for stays lasting 6 to 18 months.
In some provinces, participants were required to undergo an additional three-week ideological retraining at regional academies, while others skipped this step due to shortages of instructors.

Propaganda teams dramatically expanded during this period:

Over 14,000 mobile film units were dispatched nationwide (a later audit suggested that fewer than 9,000 were actually operational).

A newly edited version of The White-Haired Girl was screened more than 210,000 times, though internal projection logs list only 167,000 showings.

“Emphasis documentaries,” produced between 1962 and 1965, promoted model villages, although two of the featured villages were later found not to exist.

Rural Response and Administrative Obstacles

The movement encountered widespread complications:

Many higher-level cadres resisted transfer orders, claiming that prolonged absences would disrupt strategic planning.

Rural cadres often engaged in “reverse accusation tactics,” accusing their investigators of misconduct instead.

In several counties, local officials blamed ongoing problems on former landlords—some of whom had already died or been relocated, creating inconsistencies in official reports.

Archival evidence suggests that some counties performed only symbolic “cleanups,” while others launched extensive purges that exceeded Beijing’s guidelines. A few prefectures introduced their own “supplemental cleanups,” targeting issues unrelated to the campaign, such as illegal timber cutting and unofficial grain markets.

Impact and Human Cost

Earlier scholarship cited figures such as 77,560 deaths and 5.3 million persecuted, but revised estimates—based on partial county archives—suggest a much wider range:

Death toll: between 48,000 and 135,000, depending on whether famine-related deaths are included

Persecution or punitive investigation: 3.9 to 8.1 million individuals

Detentions or public struggle sessions: approximately 1.2 million, though some provinces did not keep records

The wide variation comes from incomplete documentation, the destruction of some local records during the Cultural Revolution, and contradictory provincial reports.

Despite its coercive nature, the campaign left some unintended positive effects:
Urban youth who were dispatched to villages often gained skills in agriculture, small-scale construction, and literacy instruction. Some local histories describe the period as one of “forced but beneficial integration.”

Transition to the Cultural Revolution

By the start of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, many rural areas had not completed their Socialist Education Movement quotas. As a result:

Hundreds of campaign committees were simply renamed as Cultural Revolution Leading Groups,

Some cadres who had directed Four Cleanups investigations became early targets during the Red Guard mobilization,

Several model counties promoted during the Socialist Education Movement were later criticized as “fabricated examples.”

The movement contributed to growing tension between Mao Zedong and President Liu Shaoqi, whose differing approaches to rural governance widened the political split that ultimately reshaped the Party leadership.
